                Companies and brands have never been so visible and exposed. In
                order to exist in front of their audience, they produce and
                share massive amounts of content, on a variety of communication
                channels, with the risk that the image promoted by the brand is
                no longer in line with the image perceived by the audience, and
                that the slightest step out of line has a lasting impact on
                their reputation. The words and images they share must reflect
                their vision, their commitments and their values.
